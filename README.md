## graphing the top shareholders

using the **nasdaq.com** API which itself aggregates the
**sec.gov** filings API.

Some latest findings can be visited at

The german *billion* is actually equal to the english *trillion*.
That's the range in which the top-top companies operate. So
this repo could as well be called *trillion troubles*
instead of *billion bubbles*. The bubbles, though, are 
picked as the means of representation of companies 
and shareholders.


This is very much under development 
(ported from a scratch project). 
The code is momentarily reworked and cleaned to be 
run every few months.
